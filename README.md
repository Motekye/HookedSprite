# HookedSprite

Hooked sprite-sheet algorithm for Android Java.

The Sprite object creates a sprite sheet from a single bitmap using hook pixels to define a sprite's relative x,y coordinates. You may already be familiar with the use of a special transparency color value for sprites. This method uses 3 special colors: **hook**, **frame** and **transparency**.

The algorithm searches the image from top to bottom, left to right, searching for pixels of **hook** color. Each hook color pixel found represents one sprite in the sheet and the sprite will be drawn relative to that x,y position. For this reason, the hook value must not be used as a color in any of the sprites. 

The **frame** color is used to denote areas of the sheet that are not part of any sprite and this color value should also not appear in any of your sprites. In all types of sheets, frame color is defined as the color value at position **0,0** in the image.

The transparency color value should be self explanatory. It denotes pixels of the sprite that will not be drawn.

The Sprite object supports three different types of sprite sheets:

- single hook sheets for mirrored left and right facing sprites.
- double hook sheets for separate left and right facing sprites.
- four hook sheets for 2d overhead sprites in four directions.

The Sprite object reads the nine color values at X:0-3, Y:0-3 to figure out which type of sheet it's reading. Each type of sheet has a different configuration of colors in those positions that should match each-other.

## Single hook sheets...

![Sample of single hook sprite sheet](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Motekye/HookedSprite/main/docs/hooked_1.png)

Single hook sheets expect the one **hook** color to be defined at **0,1** below the frame color pixel.
The value for transparency should be defined at **1,0** to the right of the frame color pixel.

In the sample above, hook is *white* and transparency is *grey*.

Single hook sheets expect the *right-facing* sprites to be depicted. Left-facing sprites will automatically be generated by mirroring the right-facing sprites.

## Double hook sheets...



## Four hook sheets...

Four hook sheets expect four hook colors for each of the cardinal directions...

- up hook color at **1,0**
- left hook color at **0,1**
- right hook color at **2,1**
- down hook color at **1,2**
- transparency color at **1,1** in the center of the hooks.

In the sample above, *green, yellow, red* and *blue* define the hooks, and the transparency color is *black*.
